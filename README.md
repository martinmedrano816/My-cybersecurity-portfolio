About Me

I am a young professional who is interested in cybersecurity and wanting to learn the in's and out's of the business. I am student at Houston Community College to get my Associates Degree in cybersecurity I have participated in the Nice Challenges which are challenges that are meant to showcase how good you have learned the skills you have been taught in class. I also Participated in the Cyberskyline competitions both the individual game and team based game. Like any student i have had two internships in IT. My daily duties included imaging computers for new users and setting up their machines with the specific applications that they would use. This is a help desk role which i enjoyed very much. Lastly My career goal is to become a digital Forensics Investigator so that i can help uncover valuable evidemce that can be used in a court of law. My role model is my Father who has always told me to "get a good education because that is how you will maintain your family later in life".
